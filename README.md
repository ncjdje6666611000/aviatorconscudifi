## 1Win Aviator Rules

Aviator belongs to the category of crash games. Its gameplay is based on
the constant increase of the multiplier. After the start of the game
round, you observe how the coefficient of potential winnings gradually
increases. It increases until the bet is not burned. Your task is to
manage to take your winnings before this happens.

To understand the rules of the slot machine Aviator can be for a few
bets. After its launch you will get to the start screen. The interface
of the slot is simple. Most of the screen is occupied by a window, on
the background of which the airplane takes off. This happens after
placing and confirming the bets. When the game starts, the airplane
gradually gains altitude. The initial coefficient of winning is x1. But
it is constantly increasing. The longer the airplane flies, the larger
the potential payout. If you decide that the current odds are enough for
you, you can take your winnings. If not, you can take a risk and
continue the flight. But be careful. At any moment the airplane can
disappear from the screen, and then you will lose your bet.

You manage them individually. They can be of different sizes.
